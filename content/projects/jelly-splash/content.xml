as part of an amazing team at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wooga.com/">wooga</a>
i helped implement the flash client for the facebook.com version of the game.
</p>
<p>
apart from developing the actual game, i also got the chance to work on:
<ul>
    <li>
        backend admin tool development with play framework and angularjs
    </li>
    <li>
        setting up and maintaining the aws infrastructure
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
