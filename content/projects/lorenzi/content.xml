while i worked for monzamedia in cape town, we were asked to reinvent the website of an exclusive handbag
manufacturer and retailer from johannesburg.
</p>
<p>
i was presented with the new design and added functionality and loads and loads of animations to that website.
</p>
<p>
in the end we were able to present lorenzi with a cms, a new and fancy ui and ux that seizes the capabilities
of html5, a secure shopping cart functionality and many seo-tweeks.
</p>
<p>
go have a <a href="https://www.lorenzi.co.za" target="_blank">look</a>.
