<p>
in my bachelor thesis i looked into what web development should be like in 2013.
</p>
<p>
i researched a set of requirements to define what "state-of-the-art web development" actually means in the context of
small to medium sized web agencies.
</p>
<p>
in order to make it possible to reach the ambitious goals set in the requirement analysis, i defined a set of processes, best practices as well as tools.

my writing of the thesis was supervised by my professor <a href="http://www.schmiedecke.info/" target="_blank">dipl.-inform. ilse schmiedecke</a>.
