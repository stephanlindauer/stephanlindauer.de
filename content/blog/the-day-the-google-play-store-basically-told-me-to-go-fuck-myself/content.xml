    i recently worked on an app that helps organize the monthly bicycle protest
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)" target="_blank">"critical mass"</a>.
</p>
<p>
i released the app as an open source project by the end of october 2014 and by the beginning of november i had 369
"current installs" and 486
"total installs" and i was super excited about that.
so quite a lot of people who had the app installed and usually during the protest i had around 120 devices running the
app.
</p>

<p>
then by mid november i released a new version and changed the name of the app. just 5 minutes after i published
those changes, i saw my app as "suspended" in the google developer console.
</p>
<img src="{assets-folder}/suspended.png"/>
<p>
i had no glue what the heck happened. when i checked my email i found this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/stephanlindauer/edbbdbf5087c42bd11d9.js"></script>
<p>
and yet still no idea what they were talkig about. i tried to get in contact with their developer support and in
the beginning they just ignored my complaint. after a couple of hours i actually managed to talk to a real person.
</p>
<img src="{assets-folder}/support.png"/>
<p>
so basically: "stop asking. we won't let you know why we took the app down."
</p>
<p>
after a while it dawned on me that they might have had a problem with a button in the app that was entitled "help us
finance the tracking server" which redirected to paypal.
</p>
<p>
in order to smoothly serve the app i was running a digital oceans server that cost me 5.- USD a month. so i thought i
could just give it a try and hope for people to pitch in with a small donation.
up until today i have no idea if that really was their problem but it's the only thing that remotely makes sense.
</p>
<p>
but was that really a violation of section 3.5 of their content policy?
</p>
<p>
it states:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/stephanlindauer/aa28d0594d1512990317.js"></script>
<p>so: nope. it wasn't in violation of that policy.</p>
<p>"FEE" is (according to google) defined as:</p>
<img src="{assets-folder}/definition-fee.png"/>
<p>whereas "DONATION" is (according to google) defined as:</p>
<img src="{assets-folder}/definition-donation.png"/>

<p>
so even with this donation button the app wasn't in violation with their content policy.
</p>
<p>
i obviously took the button down and suggested that i upload a "fixed" version of the apk so google can stop whining and
i can continue to develop the app as before.
</p>
<p>
again they ignored my request and after a few days sent me this email:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/stephanlindauer/ac3b43bcc5e37d28b884.js"></script>
<p>
they didn't answer my question. they didn't reinstate the app. they didn't give a more detailed explanation of what the
problem was.
it was just an automatically generated email telling me to go fuck myself.
</p>
<p>
and this is how google deals with small developers.
i didn't develop the app to make money while going around the google play payment providers. in fact i haven't made
a single buck with the app and never will and that's ok.
</p>
<p>
at the same time apps like the uber app are not being removed despite the fact that they
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8660336" target="_blank">basically are malware</a>.
</p>
<p>
this whole incident just made it very clear to me how google just doesn't care about small developers. developers
that have built a large portion of the apps in their store are being treated like shit. yet they don't even make an
effort to explain their problem or work out a solution with the developer. they just delete stuff.
</p>
<p>
i should also mention that we have a button like this in the ios app and it has never been a problem.
it actually pains me to say this because i really despise their company policy but apple seems to be the more reasonable
platform operator here.
</p>
<p>
so what now? i have released the app under a new name and will have to ask all my users to uninstall the old app and
install the new one which will be also be hosted on my webserver as well as
<a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank">f-droid.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
in the future i will avoid the google play store and release my applications under
<a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank">f-droid.org</a>
or just try not to use app stores altogether and develop web apps instead.
</p>
<p>one thing this incident reminds me of is this:</p>
